            <p class="description" id="desc1" style="display: none;">The Crayfish is a freshwater crustacean with a lobster-like appearance, featuring a hard exoskeleton, two large claws, and a segmented body. It typically grows 3-6 inches (7-15 cm), though some species can reach 9 inches (23 cm), and has a lifespan of 2-5 years in captivity. Crayfish thrive in water temperatures of 18-25°C, pH levels of 6.5-8.0, and need a tank with hiding spots, clean water, and a secure lid (as they can climb). They are omnivores, feeding on algae, plants, pellets, and occasional protein sources like shrimp or fish.</p>
